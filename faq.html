        Questions</h1>

        <h2 id="how-much-do-you-charge">How much do you charge?</h2>

        <p>Our standard rate is $183 per hour for senior developers. For
        some engagements, we may be able to find less senior developers
        at a lower rate.</p>

        <p>There's an up-charge of $10 per hour if we're required to use
        Windows. (We're not big fans of Windows, and we've got our Mac
        and Linux laptops configured just the way we want.)</p>

        <p>There's an up-charge of $25 per hour if we're required to work
        in the San Francisco Bay or New York City areas. (We love the big
        city, but it's expensive to live there.)</p>

        <h2 id="why-are-you-so-expensive">Why are you so expensive?</h2>

        <p>Our senior developers are experts in technologies that produce
        value quickly. We're also experts in Agile development practices
        that pack as much value as possible. We also train your
        developers during our engagement, so that they'll improve their
        efficiency. This puts us in high demand. But we're confident that
        we're competitive in value for your dollar.</p>

        <h2 id="why-are-you-so-inexpensive">Why are you so
        inexpensive?</h2>

        <p>Many of our competitors charge $200 to $300 per hour. Most of
        our developers live in the Midwest, where the cost of living is
        low, so we can charge less.</p>

        <h2 id="how-does-agile-work">How does "Agile" work?</h2>

        <p>The Agile techniques we use are geared to deliver value to
        customers as fast as possible. This doesn't mean skimping on
        quality; it means delivering quality to ensure progress is not
        eventually slowed down by bugs, bad code, poor design, or bad
        architectural decisions. We work with customers to identify the
        value of desired features, and always work on the most valuable
        remaining feature.</p>

        <h2 id="do-you-do-agile-coaching">Do you do "Agile
        coaching"?</h2>

        <p>We prefer the role of "player/coach". We don't like to come in
        and just tell you what you should do. We prefer to be embedded
        with the team, so we can determine the best way forward
        together.</p>

        <p>That said, we're pretty active in the Agile community, so if
        you're looking for someone to fill an Agile coach role, we can
        likely find someone.</p>

        <h2 id="why-ruby-on-rails">Why Ruby on Rails?</h2>

        <p>When Ruby on Rails came out, we noticed pretty quickly that it
        was special. Rails is a great choice for getting an application
        started quickly. (We've built small applications in less than 48
        hours.) Ruby is a great language - it's elegant, simple, yet
        powerful. It lets us get things done quickly without lots of
        ceremony (needlessly verbose code).</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-rails-rescue">What is Rails rescue?</h2>

        <p>While Ruby on Rails is a great framework, it doesn't make
        development foolproof. Rails is geared towards small to medium
        sized projects, so larger projects become harder to organize.
        We've had experience dealing with these growing pains, and can
        help you break up your application into manageable pieces. This
        may involve applying OOP principles, service objects, form
        objects, modules, background tasks, Rails engines,
        service-oriented architecture (SOA), or microservices.</p>

        <h2 id="how-do-i-know-if-my-rails-project-needs-rescuing">How do
        I know if my Rails project needs rescuing?</h2>

        <p>Is your bug rate increasing? Does it take longer and longer to
        add new features? Do you lack tests to provide you with
        confidence that changes won't break existing features? Do your
        developers wish they could take a break from fixing bugs and
        adding features so they can fix the way the application works
        internally? If you answered "yes" to any of those, you could use
        some help.</p>
